Title: mlrMBO: A Toolbox for Model-Based Optimization of Expensive Black-Box Functions
Description: mlrMBO is a flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based
optimization (MBO), also known as Bayesian optimization. It is designed for
both single- and multi-objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical
and conditional parameters. The machine learning toolbox mlr provide dozens
of regression learners to model the performance of the target algorithm with
respect to the parameter settings. It provides many different infill criteria to
guide the search process. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal,
parallelization as well as visualization and sophisticated logging mechanisms,
which is especially useful for teaching and understanding of algorithm behavior.
mlrMBO is implemented in a modular fashion, such that single components can
be easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific use cases.
