Package: mlrMBO
Title: Bayesian Optimization and Model-Based Optimization of Expensive
        Black-Box Functions
Version: 1.1.5.1
Description: Flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based optimization
    ('MBO'), also known as Bayesian optimization. It implements the Efficient
    Global Optimization Algorithm and is designed for both single- and multi-
    objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and conditional
    parameters. The machine learning toolbox 'mlr' provide dozens of regression
    learners to model the performance of the target algorithm with respect to
    the parameter settings. It provides many different infill criteria to guide
    the search process. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal,
    parallel execution as well as visualization and sophisticated logging
    mechanisms, which is especially useful for teaching and understanding of
    algorithm behavior. 'mlrMBO' is implemented in a modular fashion, such that
    single components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific
    use cases.
